By giving agency back to the user, YourPlace more accurately reflects how humans interact in the real world, without the need for central content moderators or servers. By running a YourPlace server linked to your own blockchain nodes, you create your own entry point into the most open and censorship-resistant social media network ever created.

You can do this in YourPlace by blocking the user or subscribing to dynamic block lists that include them. YourPlace gives everyone the tools they need to protect themselves.

A single user may run multiple YourPlace servers to further accelerate their content.
                                Content that is never accessed will eventually be garbage collected from IPFS. The most popular content on IPFS may never be removed because many peers keep a copy.
